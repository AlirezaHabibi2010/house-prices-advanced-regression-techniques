Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house. They probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.


The RMSE score for this model is 0.1202. The model is trained using Gradient Boosting Regressor and SVR to predict the sale price of a house with the Kaggle dataset.

Changes in housing prices can provide knowledge about consumption and inflation. In the business cycle, the housing market plays an important role.
